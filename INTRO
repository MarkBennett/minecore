MineCore is a SproutCore port of the classic mine sweeper game.

As with classic mine sweeper the game starts with a map (n x m in size) made up of blank cells.  The user interacts with the game by selecting a cell which reveals the cells contents.  A cell either contains a mine, in which case the game is over and the player loses, or doesn't in which case they may continue playing.

Cells adjacent to cells containing mines will display a count of the adjacent mines when their content is revealed.  If no mines are adjacent then they trigger the cells around them to reveal their contents.

Players may flag a cell they believe to be a mine by right-clicking on it.  This flag must be cleared before they can reveal it's contents.

A player wins the game by flagging all of the mines.


.: A Cell :.
contents = a mine, the number of adjacent mines (up to 8), or empty
revealed? = are the contents of this cell visible?
flagged? = is this cell flagged as a mine? (yes / no)
neighbours = the set of neighbours adjacent to this cell
exploded? = has the mine in this cell exploded?
